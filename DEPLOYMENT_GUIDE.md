### 🗄️ Database Architecture

**9 Tables Configured**:
1. `voters` - Identity information
2. `votes` - Anonymous vote records  
3. `issuance_log` - Audit trail (highly restricted)
4. `candidates` - Candidate information
5. `positions` - Electoral positions configuration
6. `student_roster` - Pre-approved eligible students
7. `election_timeline` - Election schedule
8. `admin_users` - Admin access control
9. `audit_log` - Immutable event logs

**2 Functions**:
1. `update_updated_at()` - Timestamp trigger
2. `increment_vote_count()` - Vote count updater

**All RLS policies configured** for security.

### 🔧 Edge Functions

**`submit-vote`** - Secure vote submission
- JWT authentication required
- Implements anonymity protocol
- Atomic transaction processing
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting ready

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Launch Configuration

1. **✅ Set Up Admin Account**
   ```sql
   -- Create admin user after they sign up via /login
   INSERT INTO public.admin_users (user_id, username, email)
   VALUES (
     'user-uuid-from-auth-table',
     'NUNSA IELCOM',
     'ielcomnunsahui@gmail.com'
   );
   ```

2. **✅ Update Election Timeline**
   The demo timeline is set for Nov-Dec 2025. Update via backend:
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.election_timeline
   SET start_time = 'YOUR_START_DATE',
       end_time = 'YOUR_END_DATE'
   WHERE stage_name = 'Voting Period';
   ```

3. **✅ Upload Student Roster**
   Access backend database and insert your complete student roster:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public.student_roster (matric, name)
   VALUES ('21/08nus014', 'Student Name');
   ```
   Or use CSV import via backend interface.

4. **✅ Add Real Candidates**
   The system has demo candidates. Replace with real ones:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM public.candidates; -- Remove demo data
   INSERT INTO public.candidates (full_name, position, picture_url)
   VALUES ('Candidate Name', 'President', 'url-to-photo');
   ```

5. **✅ Test Complete Workflow**
   - Register a test voter
   - Login as that voter
   - Cast a vote
   - Verify vote appears in results
   - Check anonymity (can't trace vote to voter)

### Security Verification

Run these checks before going live:

- [ ] RLS policies enforced on all tables
- [ ] Issuance log inaccessible from frontend
- [ ] Double voting prevented
- [ ] Admin access properly restricted
- [ ] Audit logs recording correctly
- [ ] Input validation working (try invalid matric numbers)
- [ ] SQL injection protection verified

## 🔐 Security Features Explained

### Anonymity Protocol

```
VOTER REGISTRATION
     ↓
[Identity Layer: voters table]
  - matric: 21/08nus014
  - name: John Doe
  - voted: false
     ↓
VOTE SUBMISSION
     ↓
[Generate Issuance Token: UUID]
     ↓
[Audit Trail: issuance_log]      [Anonymous Votes: votes table]
  - token: abc-123                  - token: abc-123
  - voter_id: john-uuid             - candidate_id: candidate-uuid
  - issued_at: timestamp            - position: President
     ↓                                   ↓
[Update Voter]                    [Public Results]
  - voted: true                     Anyone can see:
  - issuance_token: abc-123         - token abc-123 voted for X
                                    No one can see:
                                    - Who owns token abc-123
```

### Why It's Secure

1. **Votes table is public** but contains only issuance tokens, not voter IDs
2. **Issuance log is locked** with RLS policy blocking all SELECT operations
3. **Only backend functions** can access the mapping
4. **Physical separation** ensures voter privacy

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Voter Registration Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM voters;
   ```

2. **Voter Turnout**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE voted = true) as voted,
     COUNT(*) as total,
     ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE voted = true) / COUNT(*), 2) as percentage
   FROM voters;
   ```

3. **Real-Time Vote Counts**
   ```sql
   SELECT position, full_name, vote_count
   FROM candidates
   ORDER BY position, vote_count DESC;
   ```

4. **Audit Log Review**
   ```sql
   SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as occurrences
   FROM audit_log
   GROUP BY event_type
   ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Matric not found in roster"**
- Ensure student roster is uploaded
- Check matric format (YY/YYddd###)

**"Already registered"**
- Voter may have registered before
- Check voters table in backend
- Use login instead of register

**"You have already voted"**
- Correct behavior - prevents double voting
- Voter can still view results

**"Failed to submit vote"**
- Check edge function logs in backend
- Verify JWT authentication
- Check RLS policies

**Admin can't access `/admin`**
- Verify admin_users entry exists
- Check user_id matches auth.users.id
- Try logout and login again

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

The system is built on Lovable Cloud (Supabase) and can handle:

- **Concurrent voters**: Thousands simultaneously
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket connections scale automatically
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Edge functions**: Auto-scaling serverless

For very large elections (>10,000 voters), consider:
1. Database connection limits monitoring
2. Edge function timeout settings
3. Rate limiting configuration

## 🎓 Training Materials
